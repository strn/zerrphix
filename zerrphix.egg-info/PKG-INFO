        ZERRPHIX
        ========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Zerrphix is a new HDI DUNE index and skinner written in python.
        
        The major difference between Zerrphix and other HDI Dune indexers and skinners is that Zerrphix uses
        the dune_http functionality. This essentially means that the UI structure is obtained from a web server
        rather than a folder structure using dune_folder.txt (e.g. Yadis).
        
        It should be noted that there is a big caveat to using Zerrphix which is that a Linux computer needs
        to be running Zerrphix (pretty much 24/7) for the dune to be able to use the Zerrphix UI at any time.
        The raspberry pi has been tested and looks to be suitable.
        
        Current Features
        ----------------
        
        - Real-time dynamic menu structure generation
        - Designed to be fully automated such that once a new film/show is detected and processed,
          from a pre configured scan path, it is available on the Zerrphix UI.
        - Highly customisable menu structure/templates
        - Multi user support
        - Template per user support
        - Film TV/Search on the dune
        - Shows last film/show watched on user's main menu
        - Continue and Watch Next functionality for TV Show Episodes
        - Add Favourites/To Watch for Film and TV from the dune
        - Each user can have their own language set (images and text)
        - Each user can have a customised title, overview for film/show/show episode
        - Multi Dune support
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        - Allow custom plugins to allow for other online databases lookups (tmdb/thetvdb already supported)
